=head1 NAME

Coro::Localize - Localize variables to a coroutine

=head1 VERSION

version 0.1.0

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use feature qw( say );
    use Coro;
    use Coro::Localize;
    use Coro::EV;
     
    our $scalar = "main loop";
     
    async {
        corolocal $scalar = "thread 1";
        say "# 1 - $scalar";
        cede;
        say "# 3 - $scalar";
        cede;
        say "# 5 - $scalar";
    };
     
    async {
        corolocal $scalar = "thread 2";
        say "# 2 - $scalar";
        cede;
        say "# 4 - $scalar";
        cede;
        say "# 6 - $scalar";
    };

    say "# starting $scalar";
    EV::loop;
    say "# complete $scalar";

# Will print:

    # starting main loop
    # 1 - thread 1
    # 2 - thread 2
    # 3 - thread 1
    # 4 - thread 2
    # 5 - thread 1
    # 6 - thread 2
    # complete main loop

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This provides a new keyword, "corolocal" that works will localize a variable
to a particular coroutine.  This allows you to have thread-local values for
global variables.  It can localize scalars, arrays and hashes.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

It localizes variables by Coro on_enter and on_leave blocks combined with
Data::Alias to fiddle with where the variable points.

    corolocal $/ = \2_048;

Is exactly equivalent to:

    use Data::Alias;
    my(%external_values,%internal_values);
    @internal_values{qw($/)} = ();
    alias $external_values{'$/'} = $/;
    Coro::on_enter {
        alias $/ = $internal_values{'$/'};
    };
    Coro::on_leave {
        alias $/ = $external_values{'$/'};
    };
    $/ = \2_048;

And note that on_enter is executed as soon as your declare it.

As with most recent new syntax, this is implemented with L<Devel::Declare>.

=head1 CAVEATS

Due to limitations in Data::Alias, localizing lexically scoped variables
does not work.  Only globals (package or otherwise) can be localized.  This
doesn't seem like too much of a limitation, however, as you're unlikely to
find utility in localizing a lexical.

Unfortunately, at this time, it can't detect this and will just silently be
useless.  In the future it may emit a warning or worse.

=head1 INSPIRATION

L<Coro::LocalScalar> The same sort of idea, but implemented via tied magic
and/or LVALUE scalars.
